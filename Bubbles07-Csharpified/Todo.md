// -- TODO, CRITICAL, WIP, DONE

> # TODO List for Continuance

> Add error handling to mostly everything as there is currently practically none. (blame spectre.console for being picky) [DONE]

> Disect AccounActionExecutor and the AccountManager class and move the methods to their respective classes. [DONE]

> Add a tiny delay to the import on accounts as the user may be subjected to a ratelimit. [DONE]

> Let the user define whats a "Verified" account on VerifyAccountStatusOnSelectedAsync (ex. Removing DisplayName and Avatar as a requirement) [DONE]

> Implement a keybind to abort an action such as VerifyAccountStatusOnSelectedAsync [DONE]

> Not a fan of how the CLI color palette looks as of now, look into other options or themes for the user to customize. [DONE]

> Add base theme options to the program for the user to pick if they're too lazy. [DONE]

> Fix and debug Verify Account Status. It currently has no output or breaks early it seems? I'll analyze some older versions. [DONE]

> Discover why certain API responses result in a general exception. Probably not converted to a literal? [DONE]

> Debug if friends actions does anything. (im not looking forward to waiting for 30 minutes :D ) [DONE/BUGGY :( ]

> Implement a log file for users who will friend overnight. (literally no one) [DONE]

> Add a maybe more verbose output to the import accounts (the timer may have not been the best idea but i could just add it beneath the timer and render the latest API response below it) [DONE]
